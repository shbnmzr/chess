## How To Play
The game is fairly simple and follows regular rules of chess. 
To move a piece, first, select it on the board. Then, click on the square you wish to move the piece to. If the move is determined to be a legal one, the piece will move, otherwise it will stay in place.
Clicking twice on the same piece will deselect it.
